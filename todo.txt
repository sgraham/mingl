backtick, some other keys don't work on x11

tri raster variations via #include. bools:

- gouraud
- tex0
- tex1
- depth/color/stencil mask
- fog
- texture filtering method:
    nearest
    linear
    nearest_mipmap_nearest
    linear_mipmap_nearest
    nearest_mipmap_linear
    linear_mipmap_linear
- fragment ops:
    pixelownership (i.e. don't crash)
    scissor test
    alpha test
    stencil test
    depth test
    blending * num blend funcs
    logic ops * num logic ops (or, you know, assert(0))

that's an awful lot of permutations.
maybe better to just suck it up and make it run time conditional?
or generate a few for common cases (gouraud+tex+depth, etc.) and slow-path the rest
actually generate from py script/template or something?
