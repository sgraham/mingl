These examples are taken more or less verbatim from
http://www.zeuscmd.com/tutorials/opengles/index.php

I'm not sure if these are good or bad examples of OpenGL ES 1.x usage, but they
are linked to from opengl.org, so presumably people will do things like this,
and so they're somewhere between "example" and "initial tests".
